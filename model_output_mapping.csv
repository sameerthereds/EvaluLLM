	* ""I'm not available to discuss gossip during work hours.""
	* ""I prefer to focus on my tasks and avoid distractions.""
	* ""I need to prioritize my own projects and won't take on additional responsibilities.""
3. **Practice Assertive Communication:** Role-play different scenarios with the individual, focusing on assertive communication techniques such as:
	* Using ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements
	* Maintaining a calm and respectful tone
	* Setting clear expectations and consequences
	* Avoiding apologetic or aggressive language
4. **Rehearse and Refine:** Encourage the individual to practice their new communication skills in low-stakes situations, refining their approach as needed.

* Encourage the individual to prioritize self-care and stress-reduction techniques, such as exercise, meditation, or deep breathing.
* Suggest that the individual document any incidents or conflicts, and maintain a record of their communication and actions.
* Emphasize the importance of maintaining a professional and respectful demeanor, even in the face of challenging situations.

"('workplace politics', 'workplace')",aam,"**Intervention: Structured Communication and Boundary Setting**

4. **Seek Support**: Encourage them to identify a trusted colleague or mentor to discuss their experiences and seek advice. This can provide perspective and reduce feelings of isolation.

5. **Mindfulness Techniques**: Introduce brief mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or a 5-minute meditation, to use during stressful moments. This can help them regain composure and clarity.

6. **Regular Check-Ins**: Suggest scheduling regular self-reflection sessions (weekly or bi-weekly) to assess their emotional state and adjust their strategies as needed.
