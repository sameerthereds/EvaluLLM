# LLM-Assisted Stress Management Dashboard

Welcome to the **LLM-Assisted Stress Management Dashboard** repository! This project is designed to evaluate and rank different language models based on their ability to generate effective stress management interventions.

## Overview

In this project, we have designed and implemented a dashboard that leverages LLM-assisted evaluations to rank models. The dashboard assesses various models (e.g., **GPT-4o**, **Claude-Sonnet**, **LLaMA3-8B**) by comparing their performance in generating stress management interventions. The goal is to provide a clear, data-driven insight into which models perform best in this critical area.

## Features

- **Automated Evaluations**: Leverages LLM-powered assessments to score models.
- **Leaderboard**: Displays the ranking of models based on their scores.

## Leaderboard

Below is the current leaderboard based on our evaluations:

| Model         | Score |
|---------------|-------|
| **GPT-4o**        | 114   |
| **LLaMA3-8B**     | 62    |
| **Claude-Sonnet** | 1     |
